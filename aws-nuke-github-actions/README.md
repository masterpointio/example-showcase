# AWS Nuke GitHub Actions Example

> **Automated, scheduled cleanup of an AWS account using [aws-nuke](https://github.com/ekristen/aws-nuke) driven by GitHub Actions.**

This directory contains a battle-tested workflow and configuration that we run nightly in Masterpoint testing and sandbox AWS accounts to ensure they stay squeaky-clean. Feel free to reference, fork, and adapt it to suit your own accounts â€“ *just be sure you understand exactly what will be deleted first!* ðŸ§¨
